# Project 2 Space Shooter
Made for MSCH-C220 Class, 11/15/22 (don't ask why)

It is a game where you fly with a limited amount of fuel and try not to run into anything, but things will try to run into you so good luck.
## Implementation
Created using [Godot 3.5](https://godotengine.org/download)

Also I made some sprites in piskel (good art web browser thing)
